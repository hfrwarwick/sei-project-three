# Pubhub - GA Project Three

My third dev project for the Software Engineering Immersive course, a complex MERN stack app built with GA classmates [Olivia Flynn](https://github.com/oliviafpersonal), [Jesse Edwards](https://github.com/JEdwardsK) and [Artilla Arslan](https://github.com/Atilla-Arslan).

The app has been deployed with Heroku and is available [here](https://pubhub-new.herokuapp.com/)

## Brief & Timeframe:
- Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end
- Use an Express API to serve your data from a Mongo database
- Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React
- Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
- Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
- Have a visually impressive design
- Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible

Timeframe: 8 days
